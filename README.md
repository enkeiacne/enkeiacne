In my role at Rakhasa Artha Wisesa, I spearheaded the integration of multiple payment gateways to enhance our platform's financial transaction capabilities. This project was crucial in enabling secure, efficient online donations and transactions for our users, thereby supporting the organization's housing initiatives.

This included the setup of secure communication channels, data encryption at rest and in transit, and compliance with financial data protection regulations.
